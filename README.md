# README #

Android app using MVP and Dagger 2, Roboelectric, Retrofit 2, Realm and Espresso.

### What is this repository for? ###

The idea is to give a template that includes 

* a main architecture (MVP) and package organisation;

* frameworks for dependency injection (Dagger 2), networking (Retrofit 2) and database (Realm);

* testing including unit testing (Roboelectric and Junit) and integration tests focusing on UI (Espresso)

### How do I get set up? ###

Import the project using Android Studio. 
Check this issue: https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/2949 and then follow the instructions on [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/getting-started/) to run the unit tests using Robolectric if you are using Linux or Mac.

### Who do I talk to? ###

If you have questions just ask on github.
